   abstract = {This study investigates the application of advanced machine learning models, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Gradient Booster models, for accurate energy consumption estimation within a Kubernetes cluster environment. It aims to enhance sustainable computing practices by providing precise predictions of energy usage across various computing nodes. Through meticulous analysis of model performance on both master and worker nodes, the research reveals the strengths and potential applications of these models in promoting energy efficiency. The LSTM model demonstrates remarkable predictive accuracy, particularly in capturing dynamic computing workloads over time, evidenced by low mean squared error (MSE) rates and the ability to closely track actual energy consumption trends. Conversely, the Gradient Booster model showcases robustness and adaptability across different computational environments, despite slightly higher MSE values. The study underscores the complementary nature of these models in advancing sustainable computing practices, suggesting their integration into energy management systems could significantly enhance environmental sustainability in technology operations.},

   abstract = {This paper proposes a novel three-tier architecture for federated learning to optimize edge computing environments. The proposed architecture addresses the challenges associated with client data heterogeneity and computational constraints. It introduces a scalable, privacy-preserving framework that enhances the efficiency of distributed machine learning. Through experimentation, the paper demonstrates the architectureâ€™s capability to manage non-IID data sets more effectively than traditional federated learning models. Additionally, the paper highlights the potential of this innovative approach to significantly improve model accuracy, reduce communication overhead, and facilitate broader adoption of federated learning technologies.},
