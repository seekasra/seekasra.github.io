abstract: This paper proposes a novel three-tier architecture for federated learning to optimize edge computing environments. The proposed architecture addresses the challenges associated with client data heterogeneity and computational constraints. It introduces a scalable, privacy-preserving framework that enhances the efficiency of distributed machine learning. Through experimentation, the paper demonstrates the architectureâ€™s capability to manage non-IID data sets more effectively than traditional federated learning models. Additionally, the paper highlights the potential of this innovative approach to significantly improve model accuracy, reduce communication overhead, and facilitate broader adoption of federated learning technologies.
