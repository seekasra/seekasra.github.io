abstract: This PhD thesis addresses the critical challenges of enhancing environmental sustainability in computing, focusing on energy efficiency and carbon footprint reduction in heterogeneous computing environments. It identifies significant issues, such as inaccuracies in current energy models and the lack of comprehensive sustainability metrics, and introduces the PRECISE frameworkâ€”a tool for real-time energy estimation and optimization across diverse platforms. By employing machine learning techniques, the framework outperforms existing methodologies in energy prediction and management, proving effective in modern computing paradigms like FaaS and MEC. The research underscores the importance of integrating sustainability metrics into real-time monitoring systems and suggests future exploration of hybrid models with renewable energy sources to achieve net-zero operations.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This PhD thesis develops the PRECISE framework to enhance energy efficiency and sustainability in computing, addressing challenges in diverse environments with advanced real-time optimization and machine learning techniques.
