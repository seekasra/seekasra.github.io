Developed a MOOC for CiProVoT. EU funded project.

CiProVoT aims to develop a Trans-national training course module for Civil Protection Volunteers (partly peer-education/partly with the use of external expert trainers).
The development of disaster prevention and awareness in the Civil Protection is closely linked to the ability of drawing in the experiences and learning of this daily work as well as using daily operation in non-disaster situations to create networks with and broader awareness among other key stakeholders and the public on risk-management, disaster prevention and preparedness.
Developing training seminars for Trainers of CP Volunteers, the project will motivate them to obtain new training guidelines for CP Voluntarism.
